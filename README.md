# Unity-Arabic-English-Keyboard

This Plugin is totaly free to use, I did use the free Upersian Plugin while creating this one.

this keyboard is based on the windows keyboard style it's easy to change it to fit your application

it's easy to use just drag and drop the prefab input field in the scene and the keyboard prefab in the scene and when you are at play mode on clicking or foucsing the input field it then start using the keyboard.

here is a gif showing a demo for the keyboard.
